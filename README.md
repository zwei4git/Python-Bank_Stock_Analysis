# Python-Bank_Stock_Analysis
This is a Udemy data science course project, I did some extra work on this dataset

The pyplot and cufflink packages do not work on github site, I made some beautiful interactive graphs, but now you need to use your imagnation for those graphs.

'all_bank' is the data file, it is stored as pickle, so use pd.read_pickle() function to read in the data
